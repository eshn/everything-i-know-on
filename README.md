# everything-i-know-on...

all things pure and applied sciences. This repository contains a collection of LaTeX documents (and compiled PDF) that consolidates all my knowledge. Topics will mostly be related to mathematics, physics, and data science. However, anything is fair game as long as a significant quantitative component contributes to the topic. Obviously, this is a gargantuan undertaking. Therefore this is a personal project that is strictly for leisure.

# Content Difficulty

The difficulty of the documents will vary simply due to the nature of the individual topics, such as introductory calculus that is at the near-end-of-high-school level to graduate level functional analysis. However, I am targetting the difficulty floor to be 1st year undergraduate level. Content at the high school level would be considered as assumed knowledge and will not be explained unless necessary.
